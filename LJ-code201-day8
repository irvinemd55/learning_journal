 # LJ Code 201 - Day 8

Another Wednesday, another day that seems to be the toughest of the week.

The lab involved adding a form to the previous table created on Tuesday. It sounded simple enough but I was lost when it came to proper references within the DOM. I spent probably about an hour working with notation issues within the html --  I forgot to match the 'location' tag and missed that for a good several hours.

Once I got the notation down, the lab took a miniscule amount of time to correct. I'm hoping to have some additional time over the next few days to work on the stretch goals and make sure I get everything down that I feel I'm still missing.
