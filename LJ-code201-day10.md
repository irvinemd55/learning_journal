 # LJ Code 201 - Day 10

Another week out of way, and even though this has been my toughest week so far I feel like I'm able to approach problems with a much better approach.

I am still lagging behind on the cookie stand project after dealing with being sick on Thursday, but I know I can reissue and catchup easily now that I've gotten a firmer grasp of things.

The CSS labwork was a huge help. I was able to play with HTML structure and get a much better grasp on formatting things on my own. It took a lot of trial and error, but I'm proud of the fact that I am finally getting a handle on things.
