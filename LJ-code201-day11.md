 # LJ Code 201 - Day 11

Day 2 working on the Busmall project.

I was able to get the graph working finally on my Busmall project. It seems the issue from tabulating the entire table yesterday came from my DOM function that tried to push all the information I'd collected to the newly created table.

I had issues populating the graph for awhile, but as soon as I disabled my old work relating to creating a chart, the issue was resolved. I also had a bit of trouble getting the parameters set correctly for the graph since I was missing proper syntax with ":" usage. A solid learning experience overall.
