 # LJ Code 201 - Day 3

All things considered, this class went surprisingly well. The labwork had us going over nesting functions within functions. The exercise had us solving addition and multiplication problems with our hands effectively tied. We were not allowed to use the '+' or " * " signs to solve the later 3 problems. The first two allowed creation of the base functions that could perform these tasks.

Essentially what the lab required us to do was use the previous two functions to do the grunt work in the remaining three. TA help was essential in helping me solve the final three questions. I was aware of array referencing but was unfamiliar with the appropriate notation for the lab until it was presented to me. The array notation immediately following a function which calls back the exact place in the array confused me. After enough repeated practice, I felt I was able to nail it down in the javascript code.

Git hub practice went off without a hitch as well. I've gotten used to going through the motions of the 'add, commit, push' cycle. The new 'checkout -b' command for creating new branches was a new practice to me, but I did not have any issues with it since I took my time. Further use of the pull command combined with practice merging branches with the master file was a big help.
