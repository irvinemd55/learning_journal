# LJ Code 201 - Day 13

Lab today involved working with our preassigned project groups. We had to essentially create a situation in which our GitHub branches had conflicts with one another. I think the greatest amount of difficulty came from people trying to remember who they were in the scenario versus managing the scenario, itself.

Beyond that, the project prework went off seamlessly. We ended up having each member vote on their top 3 choices for the project proposals presented during the week. Ford's suggestion of creating a webpage devoted to recycling education ended up winning out among our choices. We finished most of the flowchart work as well and ended up dividing up responsibilities for prework before breaking for the weekend. I will be working on content research and creating a visualization for the flowchart. I intend to add any additional details that may be needed if I find anything missing.
