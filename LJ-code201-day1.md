 # LJ Code 201 - Day 1

The class today was mostly focused on orientation instead of lab work though the lab work for the day was informative as is. I ended up purchasing one of the recommended texts titled
[Mindset: The New Psychology of Success](https://www.amazon.com/Mindset-Psychology-Success-Carol-Dweck/dp/0345472322) . It seems like a good item to help me get into the proper mindset for this coursework.


Going over all of the basic commands for Atom and Gitbash was a big help as well. Not to mention the overall rundown of Git and Github. I was excited about going over terminal usage. I had some rudimentary knowledge of the terminal but have been limited in using it in the past. It was definitely interesting getting my feet wet.

Practicing the wrong way to type out javascript was a big help as well. The two previous courses I went through never covered that so it's a definite plus to have seen it. At least now I'll be ready when I see some bad coding practices with javascript.
