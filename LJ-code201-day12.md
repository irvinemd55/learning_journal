 # LJ Code 201 - Day 102

Lab today involved working in pairs to add an additional local storage option for our Busmall page.

I was paired up with Jonathan for this project. We had to go through the same steps of setting up a fork on our project that we did for our about_me project on the first week of labs. Jonathan showed me a useful link for fast git hub command references. His additional suggestion to look up github tutorials on treehouse should be equally useful.

I worked as driver for the first portion of the project. We had some TA help but the additions needed to create local storage for his page were minor. We to create a function to store information. Additionally, we had to call the function in previous work involving clicking on individual images.

Additional changes to our constructor function were required as well as some additional '||' parameters to take into account potential undefined values. I'm definitely enjoying pair programming much more than solo work. I feel as though I learn more by being able to play off of someone else who might be more (or less) experienced than me.
