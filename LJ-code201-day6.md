 # LJ Code 201 - Day 6

Class today involved probably the toughest bit of code that I've had to work with thus far. With the "About Me" pages completed and issued from last week, we started work on a new project for the week.

The javascript coding is the primary focus at the moment with an emphasis on creating properties and assigning functions to specific properties. We had to limit our usage of unique variables so that code could be more readily available for repeat usage. This required getting to know how to use "this" when referring to objects.

I'm excited to see how things will pan out since we're finally starting to combine javascript with html now.
