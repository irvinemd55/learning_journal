# LJ Code 201 - Day 15

Work went well today on the final week of 201. I did all the necessary prework to get things going for our recycling project. We divided up responsibilities over the weekend. I worked on a project flowchart as well as the necessary content.

Work in class revolved around deciding who would be working on which page. I ended up working with Rachel on the information page. We traded off as pair programmers jumping from navigator and driver every few hours.

I'm currently working on adding a logo and possibly helping out Ford tomorrow with the main index page's javascript for our search function.
