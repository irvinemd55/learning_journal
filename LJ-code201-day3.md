 # LJ Code 201 - Day 3

The class today was a struggle to say the least. This was my first real exposure with struggling to grasp some core course concepts.

Class started easily enough with lectures going over the readings for the previous day. I felt I had a good understanding of javascript loops and was more interested in the sections covering CSS. This was a mistake on my part for being overconfident.

Lab work was difficult. Creating the two new questions in javascript required a grasp of loops that I hadn't yet reached. I entirely forgot about the parseInt() function covered in class for converting my string answers from prompts to numbers. Thankfully, Sam was there to remind me how to use it.

Utilizing while loops was difficult for everyone in class. The TAs, Rachel and Aliza, helped me out with the first question and my issue revolving around loops. The second question we needed to create was even more difficult requiring an additional for loop nested inside the while loop.

I was glad to learn that else statements aren't required when following if statements, and I was told to try better to avoid potential redundancies. Adding a counter for the number of correct answers given was relatively easy compared to the code needed for the two new questions.

I ran out of time after javascript work and was unable to add much beyond my new bullet points. This is the best bit of learning that I've had in a long time, however. I haven't had a near meltdown like that since college. It felt great (just kidding).
